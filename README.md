# mss-dl
A tiny command-line program to download MrSuicideSheep's videos from YouTube as high quality MP3 files with added ID3 metadata.

### How it works
Download a single video with:

`mss-dl -u https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n491bjyC1AI`

Download one or more videos with:

`mss-dl -f list.txt`

where *list.txt* is a text file that contains one video URL per line.
